# **About**
**This is UWP photo converter (and in future editior)**
PNG IO ang BMP input is currently based on "lodepng" library, but
my own PNG (and probably FLIF in future) library is under rapid development.

UWP UI for windows 10 will be created.

Image processing algorythm will be based, but not limited, on "cips2ed" book.
